    <h2>Spread</h2>
    <p>A javascript concept that can throw people off but is relatively simple is the spread operator! In the following
        case, Math.max can't be applied to the arr array because it doesn't take an array as an argument, it takes the
        individual elements as arguments. The spread operator ... is used to pull the individual elements out the array.
    </p>
    <pre>const arr = [4, 6, -1, 3, 10, 4];
        const max = Math.max(...arr);
        console.log(max);
        // 10</pre>
