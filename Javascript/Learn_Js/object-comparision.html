                <p>A mistake I see javascript newcomers make is directly comparing objects. Variables are pointing to references to
                    the objects in memory, not the objects themselves! One method to actually compare them is converting the objects
                    to JSON strings. This has a drawback though: JSON.stringify is not able to stringify a lot of object types
                    (e.g., functions and sets)! A safer way to compare objects is to pull in a library that specializes in deep
                    object comparison (e.g., lodash's isEqual).
            
                    The following objects appear equal but they are in fact pointing to different references.</p>
                <code id="code" class="language-css">
                    <pre>const joe1 = { name: 'Joe' };
                        const joe2 = { name: 'Joe' };
                        
                        console.log(joe1 === joe2);
                        // false</pre>
                          
    <p>Conversely, the following evaluates as true because one object is set equal to the other object and are therefore
        pointing to the same reference (there is only one object in memory).</p>
    <pre>const joe1 = { name: 'Joe' };
            const joe2 = joe1;
            
            console.log(joe1 === joe2);
            // true</pre>
